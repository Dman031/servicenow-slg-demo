# Service Request Management Dashboard - Demo Script

**Audience:** City IT Director  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**Format:** Talking points (not word-for-word)

---

## 1. Opening (1 minute)

### Acknowledge Their Challenges

- **Start with empathy:** "I know you're dealing with service requests coming in through multiple channels—email, phone calls, walk-ins, resident portals. It's a challenge just keeping track of everything, let alone routing requests to the right department quickly."

- **Set context:** "What I'm going to show you today is a unified platform that brings all those channels together, uses AI to automatically classify and route requests, and gives you real-time visibility into what's happening across all departments."

- **Preview value:** "In the next 10 minutes, you'll see how this transforms service request management from a manual, reactive process into an automated, data-driven operation."

## 2. Show Request Intake (2 minutes)

### Create New Request & AI Auto-Classification

- **Navigate to "Create New Request" form:** "Let's start where every request begins—the intake process. Here, we have a simple form that captures the essential information."

- **Fill out form:** "I'll create a sample request. Let's say a resident calls in reporting a broken streetlight on Main Street. I'll select 'Phone' as the channel, 'Resident' as the requester type, and enter a summary and description."

- **Submit and highlight AI:** "Now watch what happens when I submit this request. [Click Submit] Notice that the system automatically assigned an ID, but more importantly, look at what happened behind the scenes."

- **Show AI classification results:** "The AI analyzed the keywords—'streetlight' and 'broken'—and automatically classified this as: Priority 'Medium', Department 'Public Works', Category 'Infrastructure'. This is ServiceNow's Now Assist AI doing intelligent routing in real-time."

- **Emphasize speed:** "What used to take a staff member 5-10 minutes to manually review, classify, and route now happens instantly. And it's consistent—no human error, no misrouting."

- **Show in active requests:** "The request immediately appears in our Active Requests list with all the classification already done. It's ready to be worked on."

## 3. Show Workflow (2 minutes)

### Advance Request Through Stages

- **Navigate to Active Requests:** "Let's look at how requests move through the workflow. Here we have all active requests, and you can see they're color-coded by priority—red for High, yellow for Medium, green for Low."

- **Open an expander:** "I'll expand this pothole report to show you the full details. Notice it has all the information—channel, requester type, department, priority, status, timestamps. Everything is tracked."

- **Demonstrate workflow advancement:** "Currently, this request is in 'NEW' status. With one click of the 'Advance Workflow' button, we move it to the next stage—'TRIAGE'. [Click button] See how the status updated immediately, and the timestamp was automatically updated."

- **Show workflow states:** "The workflow follows a standard progression: NEW → TRIAGE → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED → CLOSED. Each advancement is logged with a timestamp, creating a complete audit trail."

- **Highlight automation potential:** "In a full implementation, you could automate these transitions based on actions—for example, when a technician starts work, it automatically moves to IN_PROGRESS. But for now, we have manual control with full visibility."

## 4. Show Analytics (2 minutes)

### Department Breakdown & Status Tracking

- **Navigate to Analytics section:** "Now let's look at the analytics that give you executive visibility into operations."

- **Show pie chart - Requests by Department:** "This pie chart shows the distribution of requests across departments. You can immediately see which departments are handling the most volume. Today, Public Works has the largest share, followed by IT and HR."

- **Show bar chart - Requests by Status:** "This status breakdown shows you where requests are in the workflow. Right now, most are in 'NEW' status, which tells you there's work to be done. In a production environment, you'd want to see more distribution across the workflow."

- **Show bar chart - Requests by Priority:** "The priority breakdown is color-coded—red for High, yellow for Medium, green for Low. This helps you quickly identify if you have urgent issues that need immediate attention."

- **Emphasize real-time:** "All of these charts update in real-time as requests are created, classified, and moved through the workflow. No more waiting for monthly reports—you have instant visibility."

- **Mention filtering:** "And notice in the sidebar, you can filter by department or status to drill down into specific areas. This is how department managers can see their own workload."

## 5. Show Compliance/Audit (2 minutes)

### All Actions Logged, Timestamps

- **Point to sidebar metrics:** "Let's talk about compliance and audit capabilities. In the sidebar, you see request counts by status and priority. These metrics update automatically and provide a real-time compliance dashboard."

- **Highlight timestamps:** "Every request has two critical timestamps: 'Created' and 'Updated'. These are automatically captured and cannot be manually edited. This creates an immutable audit trail."

- **Show request details:** "If I expand any request, you can see the complete history—when it was created, when it was last updated, and every status change is logged. This is essential for compliance reporting and performance audits."

- **Emphasize transparency:** "Residents and employees can see the status of their requests in real-time—no more 'where's my request?' calls. This transparency builds trust and reduces duplicate submissions."

- **Mention filtering for audits:** "The department and status filters aren't just for viewing—they're essential for compliance audits. You can quickly pull all requests for a specific department or status for reporting purposes."

- **Connect to SLAs:** "With these timestamps, you can automatically calculate response times, resolution times, and measure against your SLAs. No more manual tracking in spreadsheets."

## 6. Close (1 minute)

### Tie to Business Outcomes & Next Steps

- **Summarize key capabilities:** "What you've seen today is a unified platform that: automatically classifies and routes requests using AI, provides real-time visibility through dashboards, creates a complete audit trail for compliance, and gives residents transparency into request status."

- **Connect to business outcomes:** "For your organization, this means: faster response times because requests are routed instantly, reduced administrative burden on staff, better resource allocation based on real-time data, and improved resident satisfaction through transparency."

- **Address IT concerns:** "From an IT perspective, this is built on modern, scalable architecture. It integrates with your existing systems, provides APIs for extensibility, and can scale as your volume grows."

- **Next steps:** "The next step would be a deeper discovery session to understand your specific workflows, integration requirements, and customization needs. We can also discuss a pilot program with one department to prove the value before rolling out city-wide."

- **Open for questions:** "I'd love to hear your thoughts. What questions do you have, or what specific challenges would you like to explore further?"

## Demo Tips

- **Keep it conversational:** Use these as talking points, not a script. Adapt based on the IT director's reactions and questions.

- **Pause for questions:** Don't rush through. If they ask questions, answer them—it shows engagement.

- **Highlight pain points:** When showing features, connect them back to the challenges they mentioned in the opening.

- **Be honest about limitations:** If something is a demo limitation (like the sample data), acknowledge it. Transparency builds trust.

- **End with action:** Always close with a clear next step—whether that's a follow-up meeting, a pilot program, or sending additional materials.
