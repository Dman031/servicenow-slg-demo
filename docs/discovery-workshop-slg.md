# Service Request Management Discovery Workshop

## Workshop Overview

This discovery session is designed to understand your current service request management processes, identify pain points, and explore opportunities for modernization. The insights gathered will inform the design and implementation of a unified service request management platform.

---

## 1. Current State - How do requests come in today?

**Objective:** Understand the existing channels, volumes, and entry points for service requests.

1. What channels do residents and employees currently use to submit service requests? (e.g., phone, email, walk-in, resident portal, mobile app, social media)

2. Approximately how many service requests does your organization receive per month? What is the breakdown by channel and by department?

3. What information do you currently capture when a request is first submitted? Is this consistent across all channels?

4. Do you have any existing systems or tools for tracking service requests, or are requests primarily managed through email, spreadsheets, or paper forms?

---

## 2. Pain Points - What's frustrating for staff and residents?

**Objective:** Identify the most significant frustrations and inefficiencies in the current process.

1. What are the top three complaints you hear from residents about the service request process? What about from employees submitting internal requests?

2. How much time do staff members spend on administrative tasks related to service requests (logging, routing, following up) versus actually resolving issues?

3. What happens when a request is submitted to the wrong department or requires multiple departments? How long does it typically take to get it to the right place?

4. What percentage of requests are duplicates or follow-ups because residents/employees didn't receive status updates? How does this impact your workload?

---

## 3. Routing & Assignment - How are requests assigned?

**Objective:** Understand the workflow for getting requests to the right person or department.

1. Who is responsible for initially reviewing and routing incoming service requests? Is this a dedicated role or shared responsibility?

2. How do you currently determine which department should handle a request? What criteria or knowledge is required to make this decision?

3. Once a request reaches the appropriate department, how is it assigned to a specific staff member? Is this manual or automated?

4. What happens when a request requires coordination between multiple departments? How is that collaboration managed today?

---

## 4. SLAs & Metrics - How do you measure success?

**Objective:** Understand existing performance expectations and measurement capabilities.

1. Do you have defined service level agreements (SLAs) or target response times for different types of requests? If so, what are they?

2. What metrics do you currently track related to service requests? (e.g., volume, response time, resolution time, satisfaction scores)

3. How do you report on service request performance to leadership? How frequently, and in what format?

4. Are there specific compliance requirements or regulatory mandates that dictate how quickly certain types of requests must be addressed?

---

## 5. AI Opportunities - Where could automation help?

**Objective:** Explore opportunities for AI and automation to improve efficiency and accuracy.

1. Which aspects of the service request process would benefit most from automation? (e.g., initial triage, priority assignment, department routing, status updates)

2. How confident are staff members in consistently classifying requests by priority, category, and department? Where do inconsistencies typically occur?

3. Are there patterns in your service requests that could be used to predict high-volume periods or proactively address recurring issues?

4. Would automated status updates and notifications to requesters reduce the volume of follow-up inquiries? What information would be most valuable to share?

---

## 6. Obstacles - What's blocked past improvements?

**Objective:** Understand historical barriers to change and what might need to be addressed.

1. Have there been previous attempts to modernize or improve the service request process? What prevented those initiatives from succeeding?

2. What are the primary concerns or objections you anticipate from staff members about adopting a new system or changing current workflows?

3. What technical, budgetary, or organizational constraints need to be considered when implementing a new solution?

4. How important is integration with existing systems (e.g., financial systems, asset management, HR systems)? What integrations are must-haves versus nice-to-haves?

---

## Next Steps

Following this discovery workshop, we will synthesize the findings into a comprehensive current state assessment and recommendations document. This will serve as the foundation for designing a modernized service request management solution tailored to your organization's specific needs and constraints.
